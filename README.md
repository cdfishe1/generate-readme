## Repository

Repository at [Charles Fisher](https://cdfishe1.github.io/generate-readme/)

## Installation

This app runs off of node.js and requires npm to install the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package, along with the fs and util modules in node.js.

## Usage

After installation the user will run index.js. The user will answer a series of prompts to add information about the README for a particular project. Afterward a README.md will be generated based on those inputs.

## Credits

David Metcalf, bootcamp tutor, pointed out the need to clean up my package.json file in order for the installation of this app not to throw errors.
